# Changelog

## [v2.7.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Root doctrine stack docs: `docs/DOCTRINE_STACK.md`, `docs/THERMODYNAMIC_MODEL.md`, `docs/NATION_STATE_DOCTRINE.md`, `docs/DEMO_STRATEGY.md`, and `docs/RELEASE_POSITIONING.md`.
- Math validation helper `scripts/check_math_markdown.py` for canonical equation and delimiter checks.
- Doctrine consistency helper `scripts/check_doctrine_consistency.py` for README doctrine links and canonical equation drift checks between root and flagship docs.
- Release readiness checklist at `release/v2.7.0-rc.1-demo-doctrine-checklist.md`.
- Demo strategy now uses direct Markdown links to all ladder surfaces and includes smoke-run command references for release operators.

### Changed
- Added `demos/README.md` as a canonical demo ladder index and updated demo README cross-links to use valid relative Markdown links.
- Adjacent synthetic proof README now explicitly states ladder role (supporting compact synthetic surface) and clarifies non-claims alongside cross-links.
- Adjacent synthetic proof README demo ladder links now use clickable relative Markdown links and include explicit sovereign-boundary language.
- Flagship and adjacent demo integration language now consistently frames protocol correctness as the first wedge and distinguishes synthetic vs real-world proof surfaces.
- Public-facing naming now prefers Protocol Cybersecurity labels while retaining legacy Protocol Assurance compatibility aliases where needed.
- Root release posture and demo entry points updated to v2.7.0-rc.1 demo-and-doctrine framing.
- Doctrine consistency helper now validates root README demo-ladder links and required role labels in `demos/README.md`.
- Demo strategy doctrine references now use direct Markdown links for cleaner operator navigation.
- Release provenance workflow artifact upload name now matches v2.7 verification docs (`v27-provenance-<TAG>`), with legacy v2.6 naming noted for historical runs.

### Notes
- This release remains a **verifiable release candidate**, not an audited final deployment.
- Broader cybersecurity sovereign claims remain future-facing and conditional on real adjacent-mandate controlled proof.

## [v2.6.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Root repository contract docs: contribution, security, support, release policy, changelog, and code owners.
- Release provenance workflows for source artifacts, SHA256SUMS, SBOM generation, and artifact attestations.
- Verification guide at `docs/verify-release.md`.
- Canonical threshold schemas and validation tests for decryption attestations and threshold bindings.
- Governance accounting docs and backend query surfaces for reviewer ledger and council seat lifecycle.
- Backend hardening: versioned migration, idempotent/reorg-safe indexer cursor, readiness, metrics, OpenAPI export, and deterministic backfill command.
- Dashboard hardening with proof/governance sections, alert views, and JSON/PNG snapshot export.
- Trust/proof docs and public proof docket template shell.

### Changed
- `README.md` updated for v2.6 RC verification and proof-first milestone framing.
- Contracts received NatSpec interface comments and release metadata surface constants.

### Notes
- This release is a **verifiable release candidate**, not an audited final deployment.
- Follow-up fixes applied after initial RC patch:
  - CI now uses `npm install` when no lockfile is present.
  - Reorg rewind now also clears derived governance rows.
  - Migration view DDL updated for PostgreSQL compatibility.
  - FastAPI `List` typing import fixed to avoid startup error.
  - Council lifecycle indexing now records real seat identifiers from governance events.
  - Reviewer/governance read-model indexing now includes required event ABIs.
  - Provenance manifest timestamp is deterministic (commit time / SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), not wall-clock.
  - Registry ABI snapshot export now includes review/quarantine events used by governance indexing.
  - Challenge/deactivation lifecycle attribution now uses causal seat-occupant lookups.
  - Challenge resolution rewinds now remain reorg-safe by updating resolution block markers.
  - Release provenance workflow now archives the requested release tag ref instead of branch HEAD.
  - Challenge creation block is immutable; resolution uses a separate resolved block marker for rewind safety.
  - Release provenance checkout now uses the requested tag ref so manifest/SBOM match archived source.
  - Council active seat read-model now treats challenged seats as active until deactivation.
  - Release provenance bundle now includes deterministic OpenAPI export for API-surface verification.
  - Root posture docs normalized to v2.6 RC framing; added contracts package map and CODEOWNERS baseline.
  - SDK package/version now align to v2.6.0-rc.1 metadata while EIP-712 attestation domain remains at verifier-compatible `2.5`.
